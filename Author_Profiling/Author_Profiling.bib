  abstract =	 {Many machine learning algorithms require the input
                  to be represented as a fixed length feature
                  vector. When it comes to texts, one of the most
                  common representations is bag-of-words. Despite
                  their popularity, bag-of-words models have two major
                  weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and
                  they also ignore semantics of the words. For
                  example, "powerful," "strong" and "Paris" are
                  equally distant. In this paper, we propose an
                  unsupervised algorithm that learns vector
                  representations of sentences and text
                  documents. This algorithm represents each document
                  by a dense vector which is trained to predict words
                  in the document. Its construction gives our
                  algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses
                  of bag-of-words models. Empirical results show that
                  our technique outperforms bag-of-words models as
                  well as other techniques for text
                  representations. Finally, we achieve new
                  state-of-the-art results on several text
                  classification and sentiment analysis tasks.}
