                  distribution of customers in closed queueing networks with
                  exponential servers.  Expressions for various marginal
                  distributions are also derived.  The computational algorithms
                  are based on two-dimensional iterative techniques which are
                  highly efficient and quite simple to implement.
                  Implementation considerations such as storage allocation
                  strategies and order of evaluation are examined in some
                  detail.}

                  scheduling of discrete, statistically varying flows through

                  the simplest theoretical question related to this class of

                  parameters.}
